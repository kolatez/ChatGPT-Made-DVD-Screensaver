# ChatGPT-Made-DVD-Screensaver
This is "DVD" screensaver made entirely by ChatGPT, I pitched the ideas, and changed nothing else. You can change the speed, and the color also changes randomly.

Everytime it hits a surface the color changes, increase and decrease velocity, and thats about it, mess around with resizing the window to your hearts content.
This uses the Pygame library, this program is quite buggy, and I've put some limits on it because the square kept breaking. Atleast the window is resizeable.
